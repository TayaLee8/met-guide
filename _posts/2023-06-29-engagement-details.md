The **Engagement Details** tab allows you to build your engagement from scratch. 

**insert image of engagement details page**  

The fields in this tab include:
1. Engagement name: Name or title of your engagement.
   
2. Engagement dates: You can either manually select the date range or use the day calculator function on the right side.
   
3. Header image: This image should be representative of the project or specific engagement.
   
4. Engagement description: The engagement description is intended to be a short summary of the engagement that will be displayed on the main engagement page.
   
5. Engagement content: The engagement content provides more detail about the engagement. This is viewable once a particular engagement has been opened by the external user.
    
6. Survey block: The survey block has three (customizable) options with a default text. This is what an external user would see at the bottom of an engagement when a survey is either upcoming, open, or closed.
