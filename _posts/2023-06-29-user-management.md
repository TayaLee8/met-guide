## MA check over/add

After clicking **User Management** on the left side panel, you will see the user listing (?) page.  

There are various roles within the application that have different access and authentication levels. The User Management panel allows existing users to see a full list of users, their roles, the date they were added and their status.

This page is where users can assign roles to other people within the application through the action drop down.
