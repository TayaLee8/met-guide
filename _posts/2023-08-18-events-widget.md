The **Events Widget** allows you to add the details of an in-person or virtual event happening for an engagement.

After a Superuser creates an engagement, Superusers and Team Members can add widgets to display on the engagement page from the right side module. For more information on widgets, please go to [link] (link to widget page).

After selecting **Events**, you can either add an in-person event, or a virtual session. There is no limit to the number or combinations of events added to the engagement.  

- In-Person Event: An in-person event can include a description, the name of the event's location, the event's address, the date of the event, and time of the event.
