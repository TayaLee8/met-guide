After creating and saving a survey, you can edit it from the [Survey Listing](/met-guide/posts/survey-listing/) page.

Surveys that are unpublished and/or have not been attached to an engagement can be edited. Surveys that have been published can no longer be edited. 

Once you are on the Survey Listing page, find the the survey you wish to edit. To edit the survey, you can either:
- Click 'Edit Survey' from the action drop-down
