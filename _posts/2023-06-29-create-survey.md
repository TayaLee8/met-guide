## MA check over/add

Surveys can only be created by Superusers. You can create a survey two ways:
1. Directly from the Engagement Details page

**insert image of of add survey from engagement details page**

Here you will see the options to *Clone an existing Survey/Template* or *Add an existing Survey to my engagement*. Adding an existing survey to your engagement will require no further steps after selecting that option. To create a new survey entirely, you must follow the second option explained below.  
  
2. By clicking **+ Create Survey** through the Surveys tab on the left side panel 

**insert image of create survey through survey tab**  

Here you will see the options to *Create a new Survey* or *Clone an existing Survey/Template*. 

After choosing your method for survey creation, you will be navigated to the survey builder screen. For more information on building your survey, go to [Survey Builder](/met-guide/posts/survey-builder/).
