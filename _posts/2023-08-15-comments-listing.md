The **Comment Listing** page is where all the comments from an engagement survey can be selected for review.  

(/met-guide/assets/img/favicons/comment-listing.png)

The top of the page will provide various ways to filter comments: by Status, Reviewer, or date range.  

At the top right, you can click the **Read All Comments** button which expands each submission so you can read all the comments at once. For more information on the read all comments page, go to the [Read All Comments page](/met-guide/posts/read-all-comments-page/).  

You can also click the 'Export to CSV' button which will open the comments and details into an external application (typically a spreadsheet).

Depending on your role in the system, you will have different authorizations for reviewing comments.  

As a Superuser, you will be able to review all comments on all engagements. 
As a Team Member, you will be able to review the comments on engagements you are assigned to.

By clicking on a comment ID, you will access the [Comment Review page](/met-guide/posts/comment-review-page/) where you approve and reject all the comments from one submission, or indicate if they require further review.   

Reviewers and Viewers will be able to see all approved comments, but cannot approve, reject, or require further review for a comment.
