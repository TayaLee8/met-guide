The **Comment Listing** page is where all the comments from an engagement survey can be selected for review.  

**insert image of comment listing page**  

The top of the page will provide various ways to filter comments: by Status, Reviewer, or date range.  
Depending on your role in the system, you will have different authorizations for reviewing comments.  

**insert image of comment ID page OR link to seperate page in user guide?**  

As a Superuser, you will be able to review all comments on all engagements. 
As a Team Member, you will be able to review the comments on engagements you are assigned to.

By clicking on a comment ID, you will access the [Comment Review page] (link) where you approve and reject all the comments from one submission, or require that they are further reviewed by another staff member.   

Reviewers and Viewers will be able to see all approved comments, but cannot approve, reject, or require further review for a comment.
