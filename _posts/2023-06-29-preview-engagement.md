## Need proper image from Ian 

After creating an engagement, you have the option to Save or Preview the engagement. 

**need proper image of botton of engagement details screen**

After clicking the *Preview* button at the bottom of your engagement, your content will be automatically saved and you will be navigated to the [Preview Engagement](/met-guide/posts/preview-engagement/) page. This is how the engagement will be displayed once it is published.  

From the Preview Engagement page, you can go back to editing your engagement by clicking the *Edit Engagement* button. This will bring you back to the engagement creation screen.  

At any point after previewing your engagement, you can navigate away from this screen. All your content will be saved for future edits or when publishing the engagement page.  

To go back and edit your engagement at a later time, click on 'Engagements' on the left side navigation. You will see the engagement listing page where you can search for your engagement. After finding your engagement, go to the Actions drop-down and select 'Edit Engagement'. You will be navigated to the engagement creation screen, where you can then preview your engagement.
