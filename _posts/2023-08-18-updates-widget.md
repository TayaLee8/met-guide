The **Sign Up for Updates Widget** allows users to either sign up to an email list, or sign up through a form.

After a Superuser creates an engagement, Superusers and Team Members can add widgets to display on the engagement page. For more information on widgets, please go to [Widgets' page](/met-guide/posts/widgets/).

After selecting **Sign Up for Updates**, you can either select:
  
- Email List: A way for participants to voluntarily sign up to get automated updates on a project or every engagement on the platform through email. Emails will be sent when an engagement opens and two days (at 9am) before the engagement closes.

- Form Sign-up: A way for participants to voluntarily sign up for other updates, groups, committees, panels, etc.

The Email List description and call to action are customizable.  
The Form Sign-up will include predefined forms, but the call to action will remain customizable.
