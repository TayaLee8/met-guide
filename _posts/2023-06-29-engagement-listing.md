At the top right of the page, you can select the **+ Create Engagement button** (Superuser only). For more information on engagement creation, go to [Create An Engagement](/met-guide/posts/create-engagement/).

Each engagement and its properties are grouped together by row. You can filter engagements alphabetically by Engagement Name, chronologically by Date Created and Date Published, and by Status.

The first column is the Engagement Name. Clicking that link will open a preview of the engagement. For more information on the Engagement Preview page, go to [link] (link to preview engagement page in user guide).

The second column is the Date Created for the engagement. This is the date that a Superuser created an engagement prior to publishing it.  

The third column is the Date Published for the engagement. This is the date that a Superuser publishes the engagement for public viewing.  

The fourth column is the Status of the engagement. Engagements can either be Open, Closed, or in a Draft state.  

The fifth column shows the comments within an engagement. There are four colour-coded options that a comment can fall under:
- Approved (Green)
- Need further review (Orange)
- Rejected (Red)
- New (White)
