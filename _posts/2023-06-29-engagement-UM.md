As a Superuser, you can add a Team Member to any engagement.  
As a Team Member, you can add another Team Member to engagements that you are already assigned to.  

To add a Team Member to an Engagement, click the **Add Team Member** button and start typing the name of the Team Member you want to add. Select the Team Member and click the **Save** button.

The person creating the engagement and the date that it was created will be displayed at the top of this page. The Team Members assigned to the engagement will be listed below.
