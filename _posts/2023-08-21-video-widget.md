After a Superuser creates an engagement, Superusers and Team Members can add widgets to display on the engagement page. For more information on widgets in general, please go to the [Widgets page](/met-guide/posts/widgets/).

After selecting **Video**, you can add a description and insert the video link. Please note that the video must be hosted on one of the compatible platforms: YouTube or Vimeo.
