The **URL (links)** tab is where you will find the links to your engagement and the public dashboard report.

On this tab you can customize the Public Engagement Page link. This helps in making links more meaningful and accessible. The last section of the Public Engagement Page link is where you can customize the link, and then save the URL once satisfied.

The second link is where you can access and copy the link to the Public Dashoard Report. This link will become active once the survey is open to the public.
