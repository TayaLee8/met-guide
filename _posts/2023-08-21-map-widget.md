## MA check over/add  

The **Map Widget** allows you to add the project's location on a map. 

  **insert image of Map widget**  
  
As a Superuser, after creating an engagement, you can choose to add widgets from the right side module. For more information on widgets, please go to [link] (link to widget page).

After selecting **Map**, you can either:
- Upload a Shapefile: A shapefile will show where the project spans geographically. This will store the location, shape, and attributes of the project's features.
- Input Lat/Long Coordinates: Inputting the latitude and longitude will drop a pin on the specific geographic point.
