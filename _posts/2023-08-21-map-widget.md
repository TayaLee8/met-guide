## MA check over/add  

The **Map Widget** allows you to add the project's location on a map.

After a Superuser creates an engagement, Superusers and Team Members can add widgets to display on the engagement page from the right side module. For more information on widgets, please go to [link] (link to widget page).

After selecting **Map**, you can either:
- Upload a Shapefile: A shapefile will show where the project spans geographically. This will store the location, shape, and attributes of the project's features.
- Input Lat/Long Coordinates: Inputting the latitude and longitude will drop a pin on the specific geographic point.

You can preview the map's display through the 'Preview Map' button on the bottom right.
