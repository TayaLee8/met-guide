You can save a survey as a template if you are planning on using it many times. A template can't be attached directly to an engagement and can only be edited by a Superuser. A Superuser or Team Member can clone that template and edit the clone copy.

To save your survey as a template, toggle on the option "Save as Template" on the Survey Builder screen and save your survey.
   
**insert image of toggle on - save as template on Survey builder**

Your template will show on the Survey Listing page with a template icon next to it.
