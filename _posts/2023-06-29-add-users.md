## MA check over/add - Question: is this adding users to the system or adding users to engagements?

Users can login to the application with their IDIR credentials which will direct them to an "Access Requested" screen. Superusers will see their name appear in the [User Management](/met-guide/posts/user-management/) tab where they can then assign them a role from the action drop-down.  

You must be a Superuser or a Team Member to add a user to an engagement. Superusers can add any user to any engagement while Team Members can add users to engagements that they are already assigned to. 

There are 3 ways that users can be added to engagements:

1. By selecting **Assign to an Engagement** from the [User Management](/met-guide/posts/user-management/) page
2. By clicking **+ Add to an Engagement** from the [User Details](/met-guide/posts/user-details/) page
3. By clicking **+ Add Team Member** from the [Engagement User Management](/met-guide/posts/engagement-UM) page
