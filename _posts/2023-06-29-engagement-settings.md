The Engagement Settings tab allows you to add more data to further specify your engagement.
#### Engagement Information  
The fields within Engagement Information will add more metadata to your engagement. This helps categorize your engagement and make it more searchable.

Including this information is not mandatory and can be added as seen fit.  

#### Enagement Settings  
Engagements can be set to internal only. Toggling this button will make the engagement only available to people requesting access from a @gov.bc.ca email address and will not show on the engagement home page.
