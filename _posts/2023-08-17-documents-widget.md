## MA check over/add  

The **Documents Widget** allows you to add document(s) and folders to your engagement.  

**insert image of documents widget**

As a Superuser, after creating an engagement, you can choose to add widgets from the right side module. For more information on widgets, please go to [link] (link to widget page).  

After selecting **Documents**, you can either create a Folder or add a Document.  

Creating folder(s) helps to organize documents into categories, but are not necessary. You can choose to have standalone documents that do not live in a folder.  

When adding a document, you can either link to a page or add a document that has been uploaded to the application.
