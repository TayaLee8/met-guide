## MA check over/add  

The **Documents Widget** allows you to add document(s) and folders to your engagement.  

**insert image of documents widget**

As a Superuser, after creating an engagement, you can choose to add widgets from the right side module. For more information on widgets, please go to [link] (link to widget page).  

After selecting **Documents**, you can either create a Folder or add a Document.  

Creating folder(s) helps to organize documents into categories, but are not necessary. You can choose to have standalone documents that do not live in a folder.  

When adding a document, you can either link to a page where the document exists, or add a document that has been uploaded to the application.

After adding a document, you can select which folder (if any) to put it into. Folders and documents are draggable by the dotted toggle (?) on the left side of each component. You can switch the order of folders through this toggle, and/or change the folder that a document lives by clicking the edit symbol on the right side of the component.
