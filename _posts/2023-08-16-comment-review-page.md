The **Comment Review** page is where each individual comment from an engagement survey can be approved, rejected, or requiring further review.  

After clicking on a Comment ID from the Comment Listing page, you will be directed to the Comment Review page.

The top of the page will indicate the Comment ID, Comment Date, Comment Status, Reviewer, and Review Date.  

New comments will not have data in the *Reviewed by* or *Date Reviewed* fields until the comment has been reviewed accordingly.  

The Comments Approval section has three options:
- Approve: The comment satisfies all requirements and can be approved for public viewing.
- Reject: The comment does not meet all requirements and contains one or more of the following:
    1. Personal information
    2. Profanity or inappropriate language
    3. Threat/menace
    4. Other reasons not indicated
Comments containing personal information, profanity, or other can be sent back to the respondant. They will have the option to edit and re-submit their comment for review.
**Comments containing threat/menace must be raised to the person indicated on the checkbox. No email will be sent to the respondant.**

- Needs further review: The comment needs to be reviewed by another staff member before it can be approved for public viewing.

All options have an **Internal Note** option which allows other staff members to communicate via/about the comment.  

Once the comment review process is over, click 'Save & Continue' to see the updated Comment Status, Reviewed by, and Date Reviewed fields.
