At the top of the page you can search for surveys by name or through the advanced search option. The advanced search allows you to filter results based on different survey characteristics (metadata).

At the top right of the page you can select the + Create Survey button as a Superuser. For more information on survey creation, go to [link] (link to survey builder page(s) in user guide).

Each survey and its properties are grouped together by row. You can filter surveys alphabetically by Survey Name, chronologically by Date Created and Date Published, by its Status, and alphabetically by its corresponding engagement.

The first column is the Survey Name. Clicking that link will open a preview of the survey. For more information on the Survey Preview page, go to [link] (link to preview survey page in user guide).

The second column is the Date Created for the survey. This is the date that a Superuser created a survey prior to publishing it.  

The third column is the Date Published for the survey. This is the date that a Superuser publishes the survey for public viewing.  

The fourth column is the Status of the survey. Surveys can be:
- Linked: This survey is linked to an engagement.
- Ready: This survey is ready to be cloned or linked to an engagement.
- Template: This is a survey template that can be easily cloned and edited.
- Hidden: This is a survey that is only visible to specified internal users. 

The fifth column shows the comments within a survey. There are four colour-coded options that a comment can fall under:
- Approved (Green)
- Need further review (Orange)
- Rejected (Red)
- New (White)

Clicking any of the four options will open a page for reviewing comments. For more information on the Comment Review page, go to [link] (link to comment review page in user guide).

The fifth column allows you to apply an action on an engagement. The drop-down action items will vary according to your role and the survey status:
- For open or closed surveys, you can either select View Survey or View Report. 
- For draft surveys, you can either select Edit Survey or View Survey.
