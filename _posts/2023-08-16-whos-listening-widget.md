The **Who is Listening Widget** allows you to add one or many contact(s) to an engagement.

After a Superuser creates an engagement, Superusers and Team Members can add widgets to display on the engagement page. For more information on widgets in general, please go to the [Widgets' page](/met-guide/posts/widgets/).

After selecting **Who is Listening**, you can either:
- Add an existing contact from the drop-down and click "Add This Contact"
- Click "Create New Contact" where a pop-up will appear to add the contact's information.

When creating a new contact, you can add a photo and the following information:

- Name (mandatory)
- Title (optional)
- Phone (optional
- Email (mandatory)
- Address (optional)
- Bio (optional)

You can add more than one contact and the contacts can be reorganized by clicking the six dots icon on the left side of each card and dragging it up or down.

Once satisfied with the added contact(s), click "Save &amp; Close". The Who is Listening widget will now be listed on the right side module, where you can edit or delete it if necessary.
