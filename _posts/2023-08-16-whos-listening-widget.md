The **Who is Listening Widget** allows you to add one or many contact(s) to an engagement.

After a Superuser creates an engagement, Superusers and Team Members can add widgets to display on the engagement page. For more information on widgets in general, please go to the [Widgets' page](/met-guide/posts/widgets/).

After selecting **Who is Listening**, you can either:
- Add an existing contact from the drop-down and click "Add This Contact"
- Click "Create New Contact" where a pop-up will appear to add the contact's information.



Once you are satisfied with the added contact(s), you can click "Save &amp; Close". The Who is Listening widget will now be listed on the right side module, where you can choose to edit or delete it if necessary.
