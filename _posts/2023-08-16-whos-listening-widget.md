After a Superuser creates an engagement, Superusers and Team Members can add widgets to display on the engagement page. For more information on widgets, please go to [link] (link to widget page).

After selecting **Who is Listening**, you can either:
- Add an existing contact from the drop down and click "Add This Contact"
- Click "Create New Contact" where a pop-up will appear to add the contact's information.  

Once you are satisfied with the added contact(s), you can click "Save and Close". The Who is Listening widget will now be listed on the right side module, where you can choose to edit or delete it if necessary.
