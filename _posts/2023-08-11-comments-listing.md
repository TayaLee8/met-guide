The **Comment Listing** page is where all the comments from an engagement's survey can be reviewed.  

**insert image of comment listing page**  

The top of the page will provide various ways to filter comments, whether that is by it's status, who has reviewed it, or a date range.  
Depending on your role in the system, you will have different authorizations for reviewing comments.  

As a Superuser, you will be able to review all comments on all engagements. By clicking on a comment ID, you can approve and reject individual comments, as well as require that they are further reviewed by another staff member.
