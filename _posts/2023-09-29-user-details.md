## MA check over/add

The **User Details** page includes more information about a specific user. At the top of the page you will see the users name, email address, date they were added, and current role in the system.  

**include image of page**

As a Superuser or Team Member, you can select the + Add to an Engagement button. This will add a user directly to the specified engagement as their current role.  

Below this button, there is a listing of engagements that this user has been/is assigned to. This table indicates the users role, date added, status, and date revoked (if applicable).  

It is important to note that Superusers will not be explicitly seen as assigned to engagements in this table, as Superusers have predefined universal access to all engagements. 

Superusers have the ability to deactivate a user permanently from the application. The Deactivate User button on the top right of the page will remove all user accesses to the application permanently, which can only be re-instansiated at a Master Administrator level.
