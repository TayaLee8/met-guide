The **Survey Builder** allows you to create and customize surveys from scratch, or clone an existing survey.  

Once you are on the [Survey Listing page](/met-guide/posts/survey-listing/), you can click **+ Create Survey** on the top right corner.  

![Create Survey](/assets/UserGuideImages/Images/survey-builder/survey-builder-survey-listing-page-with-create-survey-circled.png){: .light .shadow .rounded-10}

You can choose to either:
1. **Create a new survey:** This will allow you to start creating a survey entirely from scratch.
   
2. **Clone an existing survey/template:** This will allow you to duplicate the survey components from an already existing survey. This can be useful for when an engagement requires the same questions/information at a different phase in the engagement. If **Clone an existing survey/template** is selected, the same questions, layout and survey components will carry over to the new survey. However, all survey components are still editable, and can be deleted or added as needed.

Whether you choose to **Create a new survey** or **Clone an existing survey/template**, you will have to enter a survey name, indicate if it will be multi-page, and agree to the disclaimer and statement of responsibility for Survey Designers. 

After clicking Save and Continue, you will be directed to the **Survey Builder** page.  

The left panel includes all the draggable survey components that you can choose to add to your survey. All survey components are powered by forms.io. For more information on forms.io, visit the [form.io help centre](https://help.form.io/). Please note, form.io has been customized to make it easier to use. The version you see on the website might differ from the one used in EPIC.engage.

#### Survey Components  

Survey components are entirely customizable depending on your survey type. Some surveys may only use one or two components, while others may choose to use all of them.  

Each survey component will include settings respective to their function. Some components such as the Header will only have Display settings, while components such as the Category Comment will have other sections offering more options for entering data and component customization.

#### Settings   

- **Display**: These are settings that modify the front-end UI of a component. The Display setting tab will be the first tab open when editing the component settings.
  
- **Values**: Data settings mostly relate to how data is set or how data is interacted with between fields. Use Data Settings to set a default value or set up data calculation.
  
- **Validation**: Settings found in the Validation Tab relate directly to the configurable Front-End and Back-End validations for the field. Validation cover settings such as required fields, unique data, min/max requirements, custom validations, and custom error messages.
  
- **Conditions**: The simple conditional option triggers a condition based on the data input of a single field on a form.
