## MA add info about each component

The **Survey Builder** allows you to create and customize surveys from scratch, or clone existing surveys or templates and edit them. 

Learn more about creating a new survey on the [Create a New Survey](/met-guide/posts/create-survey/) page or about editing a survey on the [Edit a Survey](/met-guide/posts/edit-survey/). Once you have created or cloned your survey, or want to edit your survey, you'll do this in the Survey Builder.

Whether you choose to *Create a new survey* or *Clone an existing survey/template*, you will have to enter a survey name, indicate if it will be multi-page, and agree to the disclaimer and statement of responsibility for Survey Designers. 

After clicking Save and Continue, you will be directed to the **Survey Builder** page.  

The left panel includes all the draggable survey components that you can choose to add to your survey. All survey components are powered by forms.io. For more information on forms.io, visit the [form.io help centre](https://help.form.io/). Please note, form.io has been customized to make it easier to use. The version you see on the website might differ from the one used in EPIC.engage.

#### Survey Components  

Survey components are entirely customizable depending on your survey type. Some surveys may only use one or two components, while others may choose to use all of them.  

Each survey component will include settings respective to their function. Some components such as the Header will only have Display settings, while components such as radio buttons or checkboxes will have other sections offering more options for entering data and component customization.

#### Settings   

- **Display**: These are settings that modify the front-end UI of a component. The Display setting tab will be the first tab open when editing the component settings.
  
- **Values**: Data settings mostly relate to how data is set or how data is interacted with between fields. Use Data Settings to set a default value or set up data calculation.
  
- **Validation**: Settings found in the Validation Tab relate directly to the configurable Front-End and Back-End validations for the field. Validation covers settings such as required fields, unique data, min/max requirements, custom validations, and custom error messages.
  
- **Conditions**: The simple conditional option triggers a condition based on the data input of a single field on a form.
