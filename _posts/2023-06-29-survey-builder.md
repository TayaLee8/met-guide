The **Survey Builder** allows you to create and customize surveys from scratch, or clone an existing survey.  

Once you are on the Survey Listing page {link to survey listing page}, you can click **+ Create Survey** on the top right corner.

You can choose to either:
1. **Create a new survey:** This will allow you to start creating a survey entirely from scratch.
   
2. **Clone an existing survey/template:** This will allow you to duplicate the survey components from an already existing survey. This can be useful for when an engagement requires the same questions/information at a different phase in the engagement. If **Clone an existing survey/template** is selected, the same questions, layout and survey components will carry over to the new survey. However, all survey components are still editable, and can be deleted or added as needed.

Whether you choose to **Create a new survey** or **Clone an existing survey/template**, you will have to enter a survey name, indicate if it will be multi-page, and agree to the disclaimer and statement of responsibility for Survey Designers. 

After clicking Save and Continue, you will be directed to the **Survey Builder** page.  

The left panel includes all the draggable survey components that you can choose to add to your survey. All survey components are powered by forms.io. For more information on forms.io, visit {link to forms.io page}.  

### Survey Components ###  

Each survey component will include settings respective to their function. Some components such as the Header will only have Display settings, while the Category Comment will have Display, Data, Validation, API, Conditional, Logic and Layout settings.  

Survey components are entirely customizable depending on your survey type. Some surveys may only use a couple components, while others may choose to use all of them.  

Below are examples of the survey components available in MET.
