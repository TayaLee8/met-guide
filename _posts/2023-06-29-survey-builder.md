The Survey Builder allows you to create and customize surveys from scratch, or clone an existing survey.  

Once you are on the Survey Listing page {link to survey listing page}, you can click **+ Create Survey** on the top right corner. 
**insert image of survey listing page with create survey circled**  

You can choose to either:
1. **Create a new survey:** This will allow you to start creating a survey entirely from scratch. 
2. **Clone an existing survey/template:** This will allow you to duplicate the survey components from an already existing survey. This can be useful for when an engagement requires the same questions/information at a different phase in the engagement. If **Clone an existing survey/template** is selected, the same questions, layout and survey components will carry over to the new survey. However, all survey components are still editable, and can be deleted or added as needed.
