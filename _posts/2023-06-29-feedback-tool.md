## MA still needs updates

Internal or external users can click the **Website Feedback** blue tab on the lower right side of the screen to submit their feedback on the EPIC.engage application with an emoticon and report an issue or share an idea (optional). A textbox will appear which allows for an explanation on their selected feedback type. 

After clicking **Website Feedback** on the left side panel, you will see the Feedback Tool page where there is a listing of user feedback on the application.  

This page will show the feedback emoticon, date published, source, feedback type, feedback message, and an action column.   

The "Actions" column has a drop-down for each entry which allows you mark the issue as resolved.
