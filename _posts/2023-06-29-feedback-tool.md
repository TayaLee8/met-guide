## MA check over/add

After clicking **Feedback Tool** on the left side panel, you will see the Feedback Tool page where there is a listing of user feedback on the application. Internal or external users can submit their feedback with an emoticon and indicate if they have an issue or an idea. A textbox will appear which allows for explaination on their selected feedback type.  

This page will show the feedback emoticon, date published, source, feedback type, and feedback message.   
**add something about deleting feedback once it has been deployed**  

**insert image once this page has been developed fully**
