After creating and saving a survey, you can preview it from the Survey Listing page.  

Once you are on the Survey Listing page, click on the name of the survey that you wish to preview.

This will automatically direct you to the survey preview page where you can view how the survey will look to the public.

It is important to note that while a multi-page survey will require you to answer the questions before navigating to the next page, the actual submission of the survey will be disabled when previewing it as an internal user.
