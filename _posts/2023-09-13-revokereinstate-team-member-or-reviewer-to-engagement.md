## MA check over/add

As a Superuser, you can revoke/reinstate Team Members and Reviewers to/from Engagements.  

There are two places that revoking and reinstating can occur:

- From the [User Details](/met-guide/posts/user-details/) page (Team Members and Reviewers)
  
    ![User details drop down](/assets/UserGuideImages/Images/revoke-reinstate/revokereinstate-team-member-or-reviewer-to-engagement-user-details-page-with-action-drop-down-for-revoking-reinstating.png){: .light .w-75 .shadow .rounded-10}  
  
- From the [Engagement User Management](/met-guide/posts/engagement-UM/) tab (Team Members only)
  
    ![UM drop down](/assets/UserGuideImages/Images/revoke-reinstate/revokereinstate-team-member-or-reviewer-to-engagement-image-of-engagement-um-tab-with-action-drop-down-for-revoking-reinstating.png){: .light .w-75 .shadow .rounded-10}  

Revoking a user from an engagement means that they no longer have access to that particular engagement. This does not effect any other engagements that a user may be assigned to. 

The User Details page will contain a historical record of all engagements that the user has been assigned to with an indication if they are active or have been revoked.
