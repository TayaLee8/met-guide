The **Environmental Assessment Process Widget** shows which phase of the Environmental Assessment (EA) process that this engagement is in.

After a Superuser creates an engagement, Superusers and Team Members can add widgets to display on the engagement page. For more information on widgets, please go to [link] (link to widget page).

After selecting **Environmental Assessment Process** you can select which phase this engagement is currently in.

If the engagement does not belong to a phase in the EA process, you can select the checkbox 'This engagement is a stand-alone engagement'. This will ensure that a pinpoint is not included in the EA process graphic.
